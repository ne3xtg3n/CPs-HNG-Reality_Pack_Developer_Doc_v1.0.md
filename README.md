🧠 9. Control Flow Diagrams
This section describes the operational logic and state transitions of the DFOP firmware, ensuring predictable power management and robust fault handling. These textual descriptions will be complemented by detailed visual state diagrams.
 * [Refer to FIG. 9.1 for the System State Machine Diagram]
 * [Refer to FIG. 9.2 for the Power Management Flowchart]
 * [Refer to FIG. 9.3 for the Fault Handling Flowchart]
9.1. System States
The firmware operates through a finite state machine with four primary states:
 * Idle: The default low-power state. The system is powered on but not actively receiving or supplying significant power. It monitors inputs and battery status.
 * Charging: The system is actively drawing power from an input source (solar, wind, grid, USB-C) to replenish the battery. Output ports may be disabled or limited during this state depending on configuration.
 * Discharging: The system is actively supplying power from the battery to the output ports (AC, DC, USB-C, Qi). Input sources may be ignored or used to supplement if available.
 * Fault: A critical error has occurred (e.g., overcurrent, over-temperature, battery anomaly). All power outputs are immediately disabled, and inputs may be disconnected for safety. The system logs the error and typically requires manual intervention or error clearing.
9.2. State Transitions
Transitions between states are governed by specific conditions and thresholds:
 * Idle → Charging: Triggered when a viable input power source is detected and its power output exceeds a minimum threshold (e.g., MIN_INPUT_POWER_W_CHARGE > 10 W for V5/V6; adjusted for V7's scale), and the battery State of Charge (SoC) is less than 100%.
 * Charging → Discharging: Occurs when the battery SoC reaches a sufficient level (e.g., BATTERY_CHARGE_THRESHOLD_PC > 80%) AND a load is detected. This prioritizes battery health and ensures power availability.
 * Discharging → Idle: Initiated when the battery SoC falls below a minimum discharge threshold (e.g., BATTERY_MIN_DISCHARGE_PC < 10%) to protect the battery, OR when no load is detected for a configurable duration, allowing the system to conserve power.
 * Any → Fault: This transition occurs immediately upon detection of critical errors such as:
   * Overcurrent: Output current exceeds 110% of rated output for a specified duration.
   * Over-temperature: Internal system temperature exceeds 70°C.
   * Battery Anomaly: Battery SoC is unexpectedly low (<10%) or high (>100%), or critical BMS (Battery Management System) flags are set.
   * Communication Loss: Prolonged loss of vital internal communication (e.g., between MCU and BMS).
 * Fault → Idle: Typically requires a manual reset (e.g., power cycle) after the fault condition has cleared (e.g., temperature drops below THERMAL_SHUTDOWN_TEMP_C - 5.0f). Some non-critical faults may allow for automatic recovery.
9.3. Input Priority Management
When multiple energy input sources are available, the DFOP firmware prioritizes them to maximize efficiency and system longevity:
 * Solar: Highest priority due to its clean and often free nature. Solar power is used directly to supply the load and charge the battery.
 * Wind (V5 Industrial only): Second priority, especially for V5 where dedicated wind input is available, leveraging consistent renewable energy.
 * Grid/USB-C (V7): Lower priority, serving as a backup or supplemental power source when renewable inputs are insufficient or unavailable. Grid power is typically used to meet immediate load demands and then charge the battery if excess capacity is present.
9.4. Fault Triggers & Responses
Detailed conditions that cause a system fault and the immediate protective actions:
 * Overcurrent (Hardware & Software):
   * Trigger: Current sensors detect output current exceeding OVERCURRENT_THRESHOLD_PCT (e.g., 110% of rated output, e.g., 20 A for V5 AC).
   * Response: Immediate disconnection of affected output lines via fast-acting relays or solid-state switches. Fault state initiated.
 * Battery Fault (BMS Integration):
   * Trigger: Battery SoC falls below BATTERY_MIN_DISCHARGE_PC (e.g., 10%) or exceeds 100% (overcharge detected by BMS). Internal BMS reports critical errors (e.g., cell imbalance, over-temperature within battery pack).
   * Response: Disconnection of battery from load/charger. Fault state initiated.

Support for Expandable Power Modules
This section details the design features that allow Reality Pack units to integrate with additional power modules, enhancing scalability and flexibility.
 * Modular Architecture: All Reality Pack versions (V5, V6, V7) are designed with a fundamental modular architecture, enabling the addition of compatible power modules for increased capacity or specialized functions.
 * QICC (Quick-Install Current Couplers):
   * Function: QICC ports are proprietary quick-connect mechanisms designed for secure, high-current electrical and data coupling between main units and expandable modules.
   * Types: Includes both power (high-current, low-resistance) and data (CAN bus or proprietary serial) couplers.
   * Ease of Use: Designed for tool-less or minimal-tool installation, allowing rapid deployment and expansion in the field.
 * Stackable Design:
   * Physical: Modules feature interlocking mechanical designs (e.g., V5/V6 vertical stacking, V7 side-by-side connection) that provide structural stability without requiring external frames for small expansions.
   * Electrical: Power bus bars are exposed via the QICC to allow direct parallel connection of additional battery or generation modules.
 * System Limits:
   * V5 Industrial: Can stack up to 3 units for direct parallel power output through QICC, expanding total capacity to 30 kWh or 3 kW continuous output. Beyond 3 units, external bus bars and separate load balancing may be required.
   * V6 Residential: Designed for up to 2 units to be stacked/connected via QICC, doubling capacity to 4 kWh or 1 kW continuous output, suitable for larger residential needs.
   * V7 Portable: Can connect up to 2 units side-by-side via a specialized QICC cable, providing 1 kWh battery or 200W continuous output for extended trips.
 * Firmware Recognition: DFOP firmware automatically detects and configures newly connected expandable modules via the QICC data lines, integrating them into the overall power management scheme without manual setup. This includes load balancing and charge/discharge optimization across all modules.
